# Simple-Calculator
In this project, I implemented a calculator (Inorder --> Assembly codes).

Tokens used in the grammar:  
- INT: integer number 
- ID: variable
- ASSIGN: =
- LPAREN: (
- RPAREN: )
- END: '\n'
- ADDSUB: + or -
- MULDIV: * or /
- INCDEC: ++ or --
- AND: &
- OR: |
- XOR: ^  

## Operators and Variables
For Binary Operators:  
- Operator priority: ã€€[*, /] > [+, -] > & > ^ > |  
- &, |, ^ are the same as bitwise operators in C.
- The left-hand side of an assignment (=) operator should be a variable.
- Valid examples:  
  x = 5  
  x = y = 3  
  x = (y = 1)    
    
- Invalid examples:  
  5 = x  
  x + y = 1  
  (x + y) = 1  
  
For Unary Operators:
- Two consecutive positive (+) or negative (-) signs should be regarded as a prefix increment/decrement operator. (e.g. ++x)  
- Only two consecutive (no spaces between) signs form an increment/decrement operator, e.g.  
  ++x should be regarded as INC(++) x.  
  + +x should be regarded as POSITIVE(+) POSITIVE(+) x.  

- The operand of an inc/dec operator should be a variable.  
  E.g. y=++5 or y=++(x+6) are both INVALID.   

For Variables:  
- Built-in variables x, y, z have initial values.Initially stored in memory [0], [4], [8] respectively.
- When a NEW variable appears, there are two cases:  
  A variable first appears in the left-hand side of an assignment operator (=):   
    Valid, and it can be used in the future  
      E.g. c = x + 5, aa = bb = 3 * x are both valid.  

- A variable first appears in the right-hand side of an assignment operator (=):  
    Invalid, and you should print EXIT 1  
      E.g. x = cc * 5, if cc is a new variable, it is invalid.  

- A new variable should NOT first appear in: 
  Both side of an assignment operator (=).    
    E.g. aa = aa + 1  
  Prefix increment/decrement expression (++ or --)  
    E.g. x = ++bb  
- Valid variable names may contain a-z, A-Z, numbers, and underscores(_) and may have arbitrary length, but name of a variable should NOT START WITH A NUMBER.
